**Installation Guide**

To set up and run the Timeless Advisor frontend locally, follow these detailed steps:

- Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

- Install Node.js

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Node.js is required for managing dependencies and running any build tools if applicable. You can download and install Node.js from the official website.

- Install Dependencies

Although the frontend primarily uses static files, ensure you have any development dependencies installed:

Run `npm install`

This will install any necessary packages specified in the package.json file, if applicable.

- Run a Local Server

To view the project locally, you can use a simple HTTP server. If you have Python installed, you can use the built-in HTTP server:

python -m http.server 8000

Alternatively, you can use Node.js packages like http-server:

npm install -g http-server
http-server

This will start a local server, usually accessible at http://localhost:8000.

- Open the Project

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or the port number used by your local server) to view and interact with the Timeless Advisor game.
